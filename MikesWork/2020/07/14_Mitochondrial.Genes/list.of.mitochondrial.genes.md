### Mitochondrial Genes
- Apparently there are only ["12 protein subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain"](http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_mitogenetics/mitogenetics.html)
- They are apparently all found on the 'clone' [MTCE](https://wormbase.org/species/c_elegans/clone/MTCE#02--9)
- Here is the list of genes
> $ grep MTCE cds.gene.names.txt
> >MTCE.3 gene=WBGene00010957
> >MTCE.4 gene=WBGene00010958
> >MTCE.11 gene=WBGene00010959
> >MTCE.12 gene=WBGene00010960
> >MTCE.16 gene=WBGene00010961
> >MTCE.21 gene=WBGene00000829
> >MTCE.23 gene=WBGene00010962
> >MTCE.25 gene=WBGene00010963
> >MTCE.26 gene=WBGene00010964
> >MTCE.31 gene=WBGene00010965
> >MTCE.34 gene=WBGene00010966
> >MTCE.35 gene=WBGene00010967
- On first glance, I don't see these genes in Lu's fasta file (and there are only 12!)
