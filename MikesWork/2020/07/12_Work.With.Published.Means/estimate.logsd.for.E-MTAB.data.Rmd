# Estimate SD of log(counts) from E-MTAB Data taking into account data censoring 
- The lowest count value is 0.1, thus treat all 0 counts (previous empty cells) as coming from a censored distribution at mRNA < 0.1 counts.
- An example of such an approach can be found [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/fitting-censored-log-normal-data-2/).
- An alternative distribution is the 'Zero Modified Log-Normal' which assumes a mixture distribution which is a LogN with an additional probability mass at 0.
	- Zero Modified Log-Normal (ZMLN)  is included in the [EnvStats](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/EnvStats/html/ZeroModifiedLognormal.html) package.
	- This package generates CI for the mean, but not the SD.
   Could bootstrap data to generate CI for the SD
- "One way to try to assess whether a zero-modified lognormal (delta), zero-modified normal, censored normal, or censored lognormal is the best model for the data is to construct both censored and detects-only probability plots (see qqPlotCensored)" - EnvStats page above
- Given that ROC does not have a 0 category, we don't want the ZMLN model.
