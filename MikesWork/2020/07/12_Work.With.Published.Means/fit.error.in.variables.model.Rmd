# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(Biostrings) ## process first to avoid conflicts
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(eivtools)
```




# Modeling error in RNA Seq Data
If the underlying distribution is 
	- poisson, then Var=Rate so W = 1/count or 1/(count + k)


## Fit Using *eivtools* 
```{r}
library(eivtools)

cData  <-bind_cols(phiData, 
eivreg(
