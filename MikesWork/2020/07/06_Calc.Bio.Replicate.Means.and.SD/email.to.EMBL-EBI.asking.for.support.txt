Hi,

I'm trying to estimate the uncertainty in the count values (which are averages across technical and biological replicates) in E-MTAB-2812.  In order to do so I have downloaded and begun looking at the .RData object associated with this dataset (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments-content/E-MTAB-2812/static/E-MTAB-2812-atlasExperimentSummary.Rdata).

While I realize the general outline of the data analysis is described in the "Analysis Methods", it is not detailed enough for me to be able to replicate how the data was processed to get the final mean RPKM values.  Is there anyway to get a copy of the R code that was used to process these data?

Many thanks,

Mike
