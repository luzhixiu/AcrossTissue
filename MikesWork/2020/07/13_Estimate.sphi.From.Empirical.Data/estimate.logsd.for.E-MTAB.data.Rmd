# Estimate SD of log(counts) from E-MTAB Data taking into account data censoring 
- The lowest count value is 0.1, thus treat all 0 counts (previous empty cells) as coming from a censored distribution at mRNA < 0.1 counts.
- An example of such an approach can be found [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/fitting-censored-log-normal-data-2/).
- An alternative distribution is the 'Zero Modified Log-Normal' which assumes a mixture distribution which is a LogN with an additional probability mass at 0.
	- Zero Modified Log-Normal (ZMLN)  is included in the [EnvStats](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/EnvStats/html/ZeroModifiedLognormal.html) package.
	- This package generates CI for the mean, but not the SD.
   Could bootstrap data to generate CI for the SD
- "One way to try to assess whether a zero-modified lognormal (delta), zero-modified normal, censored normal, or censored lognormal is the best model for the data is to construct both censored and detects-only probability plots (see qqPlotCensored)" - EnvStats page above
- Given that ROC does not have a 0 category, we don't want the ZMLN model.
- This[blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/fitting-censored-log-normal-data-2/) provides as workflow that we can use w/o any additional packages

## Load Data
- Original data file is `E-MTAB-2812-query-results.tpms.tsv`
- Data processed by `2020/07/12_Work.With.Published.Means/load.and.process.means.data.Rmd`
- Data stored in `2020/07/12_Work.With.Published.Means/Output/processed.E-MTAB.data.Rdata` which is linked to symbolically in the working directories `Input/`

```{r}

load("Input/processed.E-MTAB.data.Rdata")

comment(lifeStages)
names(lifeStageCount)
```


## Analyze Data
- Using code from [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/fitting-censored-log-normal-data-2/)
- Note 0 values in dataset were added by myself when processing data. 
Originally these were blank cells.
```{r eval=FALSE}

## Find lower limits for each stage.
## Exclude the embryo stage because it has a different threshold and was generated using a different pipeline (mine!)

#filter data
fData <- lifeStageCount %>% filter(sex=='hermaphrodite' & !(stage=="embryo Ce"))
# get lower limit (which should be 0.1)
threshold <- fData %>% filter(!(count==0)) %>% group_by(stage) %>% summarise( limit= min(count))

threshold <- filter(threshold, limit==min(limit))


lifeStageCensoredCount <- tibble(
  y = fData,
  censored = y < L,
  y_star = ifelse(censored, L, y)
)


ggplot(data, aes(x = y_star)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 150) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log") +
  xlab("log(y_star)")
