Hi Mike,


Apologies for the late reply. So the atlasExperimentSummary.Rdata contains of
raw expression counts in addition to metadata and phenotype information for
each assay. In order to convert the expression counts to RPKM, you can use our
iRAP function counts2RPKMsthat does that for you.

 

 https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/irap/blob/
75f5b1fa2c2733e32ee972e98295cda746eef73f/aux/R/irap_utils.R#L479 for the
function.

counts2RPKMs <- function(count.matrix,annot.table=NULL)

 

I hope this helps.
 

All the best,

Suhaib

    Hi,

    I'm trying to estimate the uncertainty in the count values (which are
    averages across technical and biological replicates) in E-MTAB-2812. In
    order to do so I have downloaded and begun looking at the .RData object
    associated with this dataset (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/
    experiments-content/E-MTAB-2812/static/
    E-MTAB-2812-atlasExperimentSummary.Rdata).

    While I realize the general outline of the data analysis is described in
    the "Analysis Methods", it is not detailed enough for me to be able to
    replicate how the data was processed to get the final mean RPKM values. Is
    there anyway to get a copy of the R code that was used to process these
    data?

    Many thanks,

    Mike
