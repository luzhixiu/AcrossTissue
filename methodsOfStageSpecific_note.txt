2.3. Stage-specific gene screening
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to screen DEGs among different groups with the cutoff criterion of P < 0.05. Subsequently, the screened DEGs were conducted with hierarchical clustering analysis to determine stage-specific genes for specific GC stages.

“Based on ANOVA and subsequent hierarchical clustering analysis, the author systematically compared the expression profiles at different GC stages, and finally obtained the heat map of stage-specific genes (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). A total of 3576 genes with stage-specific expression patterns were identified. Among them, 813 DEGs (23%, 813/3576) were specifically highly expressed in the normal gastric tissues, and 2224 DEGs (62%, 2224/3576; e.g., Kinesin family member C1, KIFC1; and septin 2, SEPT2) which were specifically highly expressed in stage I had extremely similar expression patterns in stage II GC samples, as well as 539 specifically highly expressed genes (15%, 539/3576; e.g., Neuropilin-2, NRP2; collagen triple helix repeat containing-1, CTHRC1; secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich, osteonectin, SPARC; matrix metalloproteinase 17, MMP17; and collagen, type VI, alpha 3, COL6A3) in stage IV GC samples. However, no stage-specific genes were found in stage III GC samples.”

“Genes were considered differentially expressed if (i) multiple probes in the gene showed significant differences in expression between life stages at the P < 0.05 level (after correction for multiple tests) and (ii) all probes in the gene with significant differences in expression showed higher expression in the same sample.”

GO enrichment analysis was performed separately for all four sets of DEGs. After filtering redundant GO terms, a total of 117 GO terms were associated with all the DEG sets, of which 32, 24, 61 and 0 were enriched in the L2 larva upregulated, L2 larva downregulated, male upregulated and male downregulated sets, respectively. Additionally, 8 GO terms were identified to be shared between the L2 larva upregulated and male upregulated sets. The most significant GO terms for each set of DEGs across the different developmental stages are shown in Fig. 3a (full list provided in Supplementary File S2). Interestingly, genes related to drug metabolism, chitin metabolism, proteolysis, and cuticle regeneration were upregulated in both L2 larvae and males. Genes related to developmental processes, carbohydrate metabolism, defense responses and cell signaling pathways were upregulated only in L2 larva. Additionally, genes related to transport processes, neuronal activity, sleep behavior and vitamin binding were downregulated only in L2 larva.
